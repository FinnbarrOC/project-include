# 1) OUTPUT: first, we want the computer to show us some text



# 2) VARIABLES: we can use variables like sticky notes to hold data for us



# 3) INPUT: now let's type a message to the computer, save it, and print it back out

# 5) IF/ELSE: this is how your computer makes simple decisions based on "True" or "False"



# 6) CALCULATOR: time to combine everything you've learned to make a simple calculator!



# 7) WHILE LOOPS: this is how we can make some lines of code run multiple times, or forever



# 8) FOR LOOPS: this is another way to run code multiple times; this should get interesting
